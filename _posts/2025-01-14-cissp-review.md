### CISSP EXAM REVIEW

This exam is no joke! The rumors are true—it’s tough, and it will test you in ways you don’t expect. But if you’re here, you probably want to know how to prepare for the CISSP exam. So, let me share my journey with you. And remember, don’t cram. Seriously, just don’t. Take your time and understand everything. Every word, every sentence—it’ll make all the difference.

I did a little research on Reddit (because where else do we get wisdom, right?), and found some really solid advice from someone who passed the exam. Here’s what worked for them && myself:

1.	**OSG (Official Study Guide)** – Let me be clear: do not make the mistake of reading only the Study Guide and thinking you’re ready. The exam is wide, very wide. You need multiple sources to get a real understanding.
2.	**ISC2 CISSP 2024 Cert Prep by Mike Chappel** [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/isc2-certified-information-systems-security-professional-cissp-2024-cert-prep) – I honestly liked how Mike Chappel broke down the concepts. I went through it twice, and trust me, it was worth it.
3.	**CISSP Exam Cram + 2024 Addendum** by [Pete Zerger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZr2wLKdoVc&list=PL7XJSuT7Dq_XPK_qmYMqfiBjbtHJRWigD)  – Almost everyone swears by this one on Reddit. It really helped me get the concepts down. No nonsense, just clarity.
4.	**Destination Certification Mind Map** [Videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hf5NwUSEkwA&list=PLZKdGEfEyJhLd-pJhAD7dNbJyUgpqI4pu) – This resource is a lifesaver when you just need to know the basics. It doesn’t go deep, but it gives you a solid understanding of every topic by name/definition. You’ll need more, but this is a good starting point.
5.	**Learnzapp** – I did over 500 questions here. It’s a good practice, but be warned: the questions are not going to match what’s on the exam. They’re still useful for getting the concepts down though.
6.	**ChatGPT / Google** – When in doubt, do some research. I’ve used both plenty during my prep.
7.	**Why You Will Pass the CISSP** by [Kelly Handerhan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v2Y6Zog8h2A) – This one’s short, sweet, and straight to the point. It really helped me with how to answer the questions. If I had more time, I would’ve gone through Kelly’s entire CISSP course. Highly recommended. You can find her course on Cybrary [here](https://www.cybrary.it/instructor/kelly-handerhan)
8.	**CISSP Practice Questions** by [TIA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbVY0Cg8Ntw) – Great for getting into the manager mindset. You know, thinking like a manager is essential for this exam.
9.	**How to Think Like a Manager** (For the CISSP Exam) by Luke Ahmed – This is key! The CISSP is all about having that managerial perspective. Get into that mindset, and it will help you answer questions more effectively.
10.	**The Memory Palace** by Prashant Mohan – This technique is awesome for memorizing concepts. Trust me, it’ll come in handy.
11.	**Eleventh Hour CISSP** – Study Guide – This is the last-minute cram guide (but not really a cram guide). Read this right before your exam.

Oh, and most importantly get friends who also have CISSP (@Berny), who will help you review questions and think like a manager at 0100hrs. Thank you *Lulz*.

In conclusion, just read everything you can. Experience matters, too. And don’t forget to keep that “think like a manager” mindset—it’ll get you far. My exam was mostly technical, but with all the preparation, I felt ready (even though I thought I’d failed afterward).
I finished my exam at question 100 and really thought I had failed. But guess what? I passed. And after being audited, I finally got my approval. So, here I am, proudly saying, *“I’m Mercy Wafula, CISSP!”*
Good luck, and don’t stress too much. Just do the work, understand the concepts, and you’ll get there. You’ve got this!
