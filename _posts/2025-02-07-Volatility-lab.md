### Diving into Volatility: A 13Cubed Challenge Adventure

Introduction

Todayâ€™s lab is all about digital forensics fun! Iâ€™m tackling one of 13Cubedâ€™s memory [dumps](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbThmSEVVREpWbUJwNDk1ejhrRVBNU2ZFc1hQZ3xBQ3Jtc0tuRHNib1I1Zy1Fd01zbWRhTkllVUZxbVVfLTdnb2k0QnlxYnBqRnpWMTNjbzNmVHNxam1XNFdORzNMYUlzUHRxSThRaF9mZElyOWRrLWZrMldXa2VHN2lhZTRUNlFiTVJ2SGloaktYU0RWcEJlLWJ5Yw&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdigital-forensics.sans.org%2Fmedia%2Fposter_2014_find_evil.pdf&v=s98_p3bheL0), where the challenge is simpleâ€”extract the password for the user 13cubed. Easy, right? Well, letâ€™s go!

Tools:Volatility

Step 1: Checking for Suspicious Processes

First things firstâ€”time to analyze the processes running on the system. Using Volatilityâ€™s pslist plugin, I spotted something odd:

All svchost.exe processes have a PPID of 796 (services.exe) except one. Suspicious? You bet! Time to investigate.

Finding the Parent Process

Letâ€™s check which process is associated with PID 7416:

vol.py -f memdump_Win10x64_15063.mem windows.pstree | grep 7416

This revealed three related processes, including svchost.exe and lsaiso.exe, both chilling in the wrong directory. Normally, these should be nestled safely inside %SystemRoot%\System32\

Malicious? Or Just Bad at Hiding?

Could these be actual threats, or just decoys for the exercise? Either way, letâ€™s dump their files and hash them for further analysis.

Step 2: Dumping Suspicious Files

Using dumpfiles, we extract the binaries:

vol.py -f memdump_Win10x64_15063.mem -o proc windows.dumpfiles --pid 3456

you can also check the cmdline:

With these files in hand, I can now check their hashes to determine if they match any known malware samples.

Step 3: Tracking Network Connections

Time to investigate network activity using netscan:

vol.py -f memdump_Win10x64_15063.mem windows.netscan

Wow, look at thatâ€”tons of connections! To cut through the noise, I filter out common web traffic (ports 80 and 443) and focus on ESTABLISHED connections.

Step 4: The Grand Finaleâ€”Dumping Hashes!

Finally, itâ€™s time for the big reveal. Using the hashdump plugin, I extract stored password hashes:

vol.py -f memdump_Win10x64_15063.mem windows.hashdump

![](assets/34.png)

ðŸ’€ BOOM! Three password hashes appear. One of them belongs to the 13cubed account.

Now comes the fun partâ€”cracking it!

Step 5: Cracking the Password with John the Ripper

I save the dumped hash to a file then John the Ripped did the magic



13Cubed challenge is complete!
